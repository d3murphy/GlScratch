# Open GL Scratch pad


This is a scratchpad for learning OpenGL via this playlist of tutorials:

# Details

I set this up a bit different than the tutorials. My setup is as follows:

1. Full installation of Qt 5.6
2. Using VS Qt plugin
3. Setup custom GL widget inside QMainWindow, etc. with Qt Designer
4. Slightly different layout of Middleware directory

# Dependencies

Per the tutorials, this project requires the existence of a middleware directory at $(ProjectDir)\..\Middleware.

## GLEW 2.0.0
glew 2.0 at Middleware\glew-2.0.0

## GLM 0.9.8.4
GLM Headers at Middleware\glm\glm
